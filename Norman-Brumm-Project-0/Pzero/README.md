## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
to use the program once its installed, you just run it. There is a sign in the first room that prompts the player to 'look at sign' and the sign tells people to use the help command and that will give them a list of commands to use. There is no end goal to the game, so once you see everything there is nothing more to do.
